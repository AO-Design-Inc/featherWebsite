                    Modernizing an Industry Standard
                </h2>

                <p class="section-text">The Business Owners Advisory Council (BOAC) is a forum of industry leaders and successful entrepreneurs that share information and critical strategies to achieve professional and personal objectives. 

As part of a 2021 complete relaunch of the BOAC, we were tasked with giving the brand the legitimacy it deserved while maintaining it’s core values of diversity and inclusion. The conservation of a functional blogging system to keep members up to date while building a fresh digital face for public awareness was a dual task that required a rethinking of how to design a professional forum.</p>

                    Three Key Goals
                </h2>

                <p class="section-text">BOAC leaders were looking to expand outside of their Long Island roots and build their network nationally around the United States. Their existing website was haphazardly designed, lacked organization and created confusion over the BOAC’s mission for prospective members. Complicating this, the on going pandemic restricted physical promotion and made digital presence more important than ever before. 

With this problem in mind, the BOAC brought us into the loop to rework their digital portfolio and design something that represented their new expansion initiatives. Three primary goals were set; to improve recognition, increase member conversions, and keep existing members in the loop on events.</p>

                    Discovering the Brand Through Interviews
                </h2>

                <p class="section-text">To understand the project better, we conducted interviews with BOAC&#39;s leadership to help us understand the brand as well as the direction that they looked to bring the BOAC towards. These interviews allowed us to break down the issue into the formerly mentioned three primary goals, and shaped our future implementation strategy that required both a focus on content delivery to existing users and a platform for stakeholders to learn more about the BOAC itself. We also learned of how the BOAC intends to utilize the site as primarily an awareness tool by directing users to the site physically during events and workshops.</p>

                    Analyzing the Content
                </h2>

                <p class="section-text">While analyzing BOAC’s previous website it was clear that the site was not in line with the professional presence and future thinking mindset that BOAC set out to accomplish. The previous site did not achieve the BOAC&#39;s goals of being seen as a leading organization for business owners and advisors. The existing site was described - even in relation to the older designs of other competitors - to be outdated, boring, and confusing. 

The site was built on a simplistic and old single page grid template leading to confusing navigation and the site looking outdated. The site lacked a content management system (CMS) which led to issues updating content and required direct edits to the page itself. This meant it was difficult to update material without breaking something on the front end of the site. Compared to the BOAC’s other branding material, the website also severely lacked cohesion. Therefore we focused our redesign on reformatting the site navigation structure, implementing more imagery and colors representing the BOAC, and making content updates easier through a CMS system.</p>

                    The Two Pronged Approach
                </h2>

                <p class="section-text">Aligning the site with the existing brand is only one of the two tasks we needed to address. As the BOAC catered to two seperate groups of users, identifying and maintaining relevant information was key. We catagorized these users as either Members or Explorers.

From our discovery we learned that the primary way that Explorers would navigate to the site is through direct linking rather than through organic search. We also found that Members required quick access to utilize the site as a dashboard of upcoming workshops and new articles.

Our strategy required a two pronged approach. First we transformed the root domain of the site into a dashboard of the latest important articles alongside upcoming workshops to keep members informed. For explorers we utilize the /about page path as the page many marketing content would link to.  We further segmented the original one page design of the site into a 6 page layout targeted towards allowing explorers to learn more about past workshops, articles, and ambassadors with future expansion easily accessible.</p>
